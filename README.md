Almost everything inside the game is not official. So if you find a bug, just tell me in the discord (EJAE#0970). Share your opinions about the movements, tactics, techniques, and other stuff.Read the explanations in red text inside the game to fully understand how to use the movements and equipment.
Some things are still broken, so yeah.
