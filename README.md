Open "ChatGPT" only. Don't open other files because it might make you download a software.
This is a testing game. It is not official yet. Share your opinions about the movements, tactics, techniques, and other stuff.
Read the explanations in red text inside the game to fully understand how to use the movements and equipment.
Some things are still broken, so yeah.

I haven't made a quit button or any menu buttons, so if you want to leave the game just ALT + F4 or end task
with task manager.
